    We believe in souls. We believe in soul mates. Our photos
    aim to capture people at their best and their worst -
    when there&rsquo;s nothing left to be said and it's all out on
    the table. Our perfect shot is not about lighting. It&rsquo;s
    not about poses. It&rsquo;s about you. We want to get to know
    you so that we can capture the moments you&rsquo;ll cherish
    forever.

    When we shoot your event, you&rsquo;ll receive about 300 high
    resolution photographs, minimally retouched. We&rsquo;ll also
    leave you with a package of roughly 30 unique prints.
    We may use some of our favorite shots for our website,
    with your permission of course.

    Our signature photo captures the emotion and the spirit of
    your event.
